notes...


```
// python
d1 = datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=15)
d2 = datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(hours=1)

// js
Date.prototype.addHours = function(h) {
  this.setTime(this.getTime() + (h*60*60*1000));
  return this;
}
```

goals..

```
earlier = Date.from_phrase('Yesterday') + "1 hour"
while now < earlier:
    print(now)
    now += "1 hour"
```

## TODO

Dates() - for a range of dates.



## Dev Notes

The entry point the Date object is masked by a function with the same name.

i.e.

```bash
from stringtime import Date
```

is different to...

```bash
from stringtime.date import Date
```

In general use the first way unless you want to use the Date object directly without the wrapper.
